# Roll 'Em

This is the code for https://rollem.co, a site for rolling dice.

## Set up

If you have git and node.js, you can checkout and build the site with:

```
git clone https://github.com/forrestjacobs/roll-em.git
cd roll-em
npm install
npm run build
```

That generates a `dist` directory with the site's static resources. Roll 'Em is
a totally static site, so you can just serve that directory.
